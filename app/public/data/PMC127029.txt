SS750 [(R)-()-2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-1-(ethylsulfonyl)-1,1-difluoro-3-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-2-propanol] is
a new triazole, and its potential as an antifungal agent was evaluated by in vitro and in vivo studies. In a
comparison of the MICs at which 50% of isolates are inhibited (MIC50s) for all strains of Candida species and
Cryptococcus neoformans tested, SS750 was four times or more active than fluconazole and had activity
comparable to that of itraconazole. The most important advantage of SS750 was that, when the MIC90s were
compared, SS750 had 64 and 32 times greater antifungal activities than fluconazole against Candida krusei and
Candida glabrata, respectively, which are intrinsically less susceptible to fluconazole. In cyclophosphamide-
immunosuppressed mouse models of systemic and pulmonary candidiasis caused by C. albicans, oral SS750
prolonged the number of days of survival of infected animals in a dose-dependent manner and was 4 and >64
times more potent than fluconazole and itraconazole, respectively. In a safety profile, SS750, like fluconazole,
had less of an affinity for binding to mammalian cytochrome P450 compared with that of ketoconazole, despite
its strong affinity for binding to fungal cytochrome P450. The mechanism for the increased in vitro antifungal
activity of SS750 against C. krusei is partially due to the potent inhibitory activity (3.7 times versus that of
fluconazole) of C. krusei cytochrome P450 sterol 14-demethylase; SS750 showed a strong affinity for binding
to cytochrome P450 of C. krusei, indicating that SS750 acts by inhibiting the cytochrome P450 sterol 14-
demethylase of fungal cells.
The incidence of opportunistic fungal infections has been
increasing worldwide, especially due to the increase in the
number of hosts immunocompromised because of cancer che-
motherapy, organ and bone marrow transplantation, and hu-
man immunodeficiency virus infection (3, 8, 17, 24). Flucon-
azole (FLC) has been used with considerable success in the
treatment of serious fungal infections caused by Candida albi-
cans, a major opportunistic pathogen (7).
However, extensive use of FLC has led to increases in the
numbers of FLC-resistant C. albicans isolates causing oropha-
ryngeal candidiasis in human immunodeficiency virus-infected
individuals and the numbers of non-C. albicans species that are
less susceptible to FLC, such as Candida glabrata and Candida
krusei (20). Moreover, although itraconazole (ITC) is also
available as an alternative for such patients, its unpredictable
lower concentration in plasma due to its highly hydrophobic
nature has caused therapeutic failures in some cases (9, 19).
Amphotericin B (AMB) remains the “gold standard” drug for
life-threatening fungal infections, but its use is limited due to
its severe toxicity and the inconvenience of intravenous dosing
(18, 21).
Keeping these risk factors, adverse effects, and inconve-
niences in mind, we have attempted to develop new antifungal
agents. In general, the azole compound is much less toxic than
polyene antibiotics, e.g., AMB. Specifically, we have devoted
attention to the azole compound, an ergosterol synthesis in-
hibitor, as a target for development.
In order to enhance the in vitro and in vivo antifungal ac-
tivities of this compound against pathogenic fungi, including
strains less susceptible to FLC, we introduced fluorine atoms
into antifungal triazoles; our research focused on discovering
new azoles with a gem-difluoromethylene moiety (2). The in-
troduction of fluorine into an organic molecule causes dra-
matic changes in biological activity, mainly because of the high
electronegativity of fluorine, the strong carbon-fluorine bond,
and the increased lipid solubility because of its relatively low
molecular weight. We selected SS750 among various candi-
dates for further evaluation because of its strong antifungal
activity and lower level of toxicity (Fig. 1). It is strongly sug-
gested that the ethylsulfonyl gem-difluoromethylene moiety in
this molecule, coupled with its improved hydrophobic property
compared with that of FLC, leads to increased antifungal ac-
tivities against pathogenic fungi (S. Takeda, Y. Kaneko, M.
Tokizawa, H. Eto, and S. Sato, Abstr. 40th Intersci. Conf.
Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., abstr. 1080, p. 198, 2000).
Furthermore, in comparison to FLC, SS750 has a broader
antifungal spectrum and much stronger activity against patho-
genic fungi, including filamentous fungi (K. Yokoyama, L.
Wang, H. Kaji, J. Ito, M. Matsumoto, K. Kamei, K. Nishimura,
and M. Miyaji, Abstr. 40th Intersci. Conf. Antimicrob. Agents
Chemother., abstr. 1084, p. 199, 2000).
In the present study, we evaluated the in vitro antifungal
activity of SS750 against Candida species and Cryptococcus
neoformans, its oral efficacy against candidiasis in mice, its

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals. SS750 [(R)-()-2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-1-(ethylsulfonyl)-1,1-dif-
luoro-3-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-2-propanol] was synthesized at SSP Co., Ltd., To-
kyo, Japan. FLC and ITC were purchased from Pfizer Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
Tokyo, Japan, and Janssen-Kyowa Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan, respectively. AMB
and ketoconazole (KTC) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan. [2-14C]mevalonic acid dibenzylethylenediamine salt (specific activity, 66.0
mCi/mmol) was purchased from Nycomed Amersham plc (Amersham, United
Kingdom).
Fungus strains. Most of the strains used in the present study were obtained
from the Research Center for Pathogenic Fungi and Microbial Toxicoses, Chiba
University, Chiba, Japan, and other suppliers. C. albicans ATCC 90028 and C.
krusei ATCC 6258 were also obtained from the American Type Culture Collec-
tion (Manassas, Va.).
In vitro antifungal activity. The MICs of SS750 and the generally proven
reference drugs FLC, ITC, and AMB for Candida species and C. neoformans
were determined by a broth microdilution method according to National Com-
mittee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) method M27-A (14). SS750
was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The strains were cultured at 35°C
for 46 to 50 h. The MICs were read spectrophotometrically (Microplate Reader
M-Vmax; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan). The MICs of
SS750, FLC, and ITC were defined as the lowest concentration at which there
was 80% inhibition of growth compared with the growth of a drug-free control;
the MIC of AMB was defined as the lowest concentration at which there was
100% inhibition of growth.
Therapeutic effects on systemic and pulmonary candidiasis in immunosup-
pressed mice. C. albicans IFM 40009 was grown on Sabouraud dextrose agar
plates (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.) at 37°C for 24 h and was prepared
with sterile saline at a concentration of 5 105 cells/ml for systemic infection and
1  108 cells/ml for pulmonary infection. Five-week-old male ICR mice (weight,
22 to 26 g; Charles River Japan, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan) were used (10 mice per
group). They were housed in cages of 10 per group and had access to food and
water ad libitum. This study keenly respected established guidelines (6). For
immunosuppression, cyclophosphamide (Endoxan; Shionogi & Co., Ltd., Osaka,
Japan) was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 100 mg/kg of body weight
per day on day 4 and day 1 before infection, on day 3 after infection, and every
4th day thereafter. Two-tenths milliliter (105 CFU) of the fungal suspension was
injected into the tail vein for systemic infection. For the pulmonary infection
study, 50 l (5  106 CFU) of the fungal suspension was intranasally inoculated
after the animals were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (Veterinary
Ketalar 50; Sankyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at 20 mg/kg intravenously. SS750
and the triazole derivatives of FLC and ITC were orally administered once a day
for 4 consecutive days, starting at 1 h after infection. The desired drug dose was
given in a volume of 0.1 ml per 10 g of body weight. Fasting took place for 5 h
before the first administration. As a solvent for SS750 and FLC, 0.5% carboxy-
methyl cellulose-sodium was used, and for ITC, 40% (wt/vol) hydroxypropyl--
cyclodextrin (Funakoshi Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was used by a method slightly
modified from that reported previously (13). The infection control group was
untreated. The animals were observed for survival or death for 21 days after
infection. The duration of survival was determined by the Kaplan-Meier tech-
nique and was analyzed by the log rank test. Each series of experiments was
performed at least in duplicate to ensure the consistency of the results.
Cell-free ergosterol biosynthesis assay. In order to study the inhibitory effects
of SS750, FLC, and ITC on cell-free ergosterol biosynthesis, C. albicans ATCC
90028 (a reference strain according to NCCLS guidelines [14]) and C. krusei
ATCC 6258 (a quality control strain according to NCCLS guidelines [14]) were
used. Crude enzyme was prepared, and sterol biosynthesis was measured by
methods similar to those reported previously (5, 12, 16). Each strain was cultured
at 30°C for 13 h in YPG broth (1% Bacto Peptone, 1% yeast extract, 4% glucose)
under conditions of shaking at 110 or 90 rpm. The cells were then harvested by
centrifugation at 1,500  g for 5 min at 4°C and were washed twice with cold
distilled water and suspended in cold buffer A (100 mM potassium phosphate
[pH 7.4], 30 nM nicotinamide, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM reduced glutathione). The
cells were mixed with an equal volume of glass beads (diameter, 0.45 to 0.5 mm)
and were homogenized with a cell homogenizer (Braun GmbH, Mesungen,
Germany) operating at 4,000 rpm with nine 10-s bursts and intervals of 30 s with
liquid carbon dioxide cooling (1). The cell debris and glass beads were removed
by centrifugation at 1,500  g for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatants were centri-
fuged twice at 10,000  g for 20 min at 4°C, and the cell-free supernatants were
stored at 80°C before use. The protein concentration was quantified by the
method of Lowry et al. (10). The cell-free supernatants were diluted with buffer
A at 11.4 mg of protein/ml; MgCl2 and MnCl2 (61.0 and 39.6 mg/ml, respectively,
in distilled water) were added at 10 l/ml. This mixture was used as the crude
enzyme extract. The reaction mixture consisted of crude enzyme extract (880 l),
a solution of an antifungal drug dissolved in DMSO (10 l), [2-14C]mevalonate
(10 l, 0.25 Ci), and cofactor solution (100 l containing 6 M ATP, 3 M
glucose-6-phosphate, 1 M NADPH, and 1 M NAD in 1 mM potassium
phosphate buffer [pH 7.4]). The mixture was incubated at 30°C for 30 min with
shaking (100 rpm). The reaction was then stopped by adding 1 ml of freshly
prepared saponification reagent (15% [wt/vol] KOH in 90% [vol/vol] ethanol);
the mixture was heated at 80°C for 1 h for saponification. Nonsaponifiable lipids
(sterols and sterol precursors) were extracted twice with 2 ml of n-heptane and
were dried under nitrogen at 40°C. The nonsaponifiable lipid was applied to silica
gel 60-precoated thin-layer chromatography plates (Merck Co., Ltd.), and the
plates were developed with n-heptane, diisopropylether, acetic acid, and ethyl
acetate (60:40:4:34.7; vol/vol). Radioactive metabolite zones were located and
quantified with a BAS 2000 imaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan).
Affinity of binding to microsomal cytochrome P450. We compared the affin-
ities of binding of SS750, FLC, and ITC to microsomal cytochrome P450 in C.
albicans ATCC 90028 and C. krusei ATCC 6258. KTC, an imidazole derivative,
was additionally used in a comparison of affinities of binding to microsomal
cytochrome P450 in rat and human liver. Rat and human liver microsomal
fractions were purchased from Charles River Japan, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan, and
from Gentest Co., Woburn, Mass., respectively. Fungus microsomal fractions
were prepared by methods similar to those reported previously (5, 22). Each test
strain was precultured in YPG broth medium (1% yeast extract, 1% Bacto
Peptone, 2% glucose) at 30°C for 16 h and inoculated and cultured in 4%
glucose-containing YPG broth medium at 30°C for 13 h under agitation at 110
rpm. Cells in the logarithmic phase were obtained. These cells were harvested by
centrifugation at 1,500  g for 5 min; washed with distilled water; suspended in
50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1.2 M sorbitol, 10 mM
disodium EDTA, and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol; and incubated at 30°C for 30
min. Then, Zymolyase-20T (15 mg per 1 g [wet weight] of cells; Seikagaku Corp.,
Tokyo, Japan) was added and the suspension was gently stirred at 30°C for 90
min. The spheroplasts were harvested by centrifugation at 1,500  g for 5 min.
After being washed with 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing
1.2 M sorbitol and 10 mM disodium EDTA, the spheroplasts were suspended in
100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 mM disodium
EDTA and 0.1 mM reduced glutathione. This spheroplast suspension was ho-
mogenized in a glass homogenizer and was centrifuged at 1,500  g for 5 min to
remove debris and unbroken spheroplasts. The supernatant was centrifuged
twice at 10,000  g for 20 min, followed by centrifugation at 105,000  g for 90
min to produce a pellet. The pellet was suspended in 100 mM potassium phos-
phate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 20% (vol/vol) glycerol and was stored at 80°C
until use. The cytochrome P450 contents in all microsomal fractions were mea-
sured and were calculated by a previously reported method (15) as the difference

in the absorbance between 448 nm (C. albicans and C. krusei) or 450 nm (rat and
human) and 490 nm from that for the control. Each microsomal suspension was
diluted with 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) so that the cyto-
chrome P450 concentration was 0.15 nM per ml. An antifungal drug solution of
2.2 l in DMSO was added to a 1.5-ml tube containing 550 l of the microsomal
suspension, and the tube was incubated at 37°C for 10 min (final DMSO con-
centration, 0.4%). The suspensions reduced with sodium hydrosulfite were trans-
ferred to semimicro quartz cells. Carbon monoxide was used to aerate the
suspensions for 30 s. One minute later, the absorption spectrum from 550 to 360
nm was measured with a spectrophotometer (DU 640; Beckman Instruments
Inc., Fullerton, Calif.). The differences in the absorbance between 448 nm (C.
albicans and C. krusei) or 450 nm (rat and human) and 490 nm were compared.
RESULTS
In vitro antifungal activity. The MICs of SS750, FLC, ITC,
and AMB for Candida species and C. neoformans, most of
which were isolated clinically, are shown in Table 1. The data
are presented as MIC ranges, the MICs at which 50% of
isolates are inhibited (MIC50s), and MIC90s. The MIC90 of
SS750 for 55 strains of C. albicans was 0.125 g/ml, which was
four times greater than those of FLC and AMB and two times
less than that of ITC. On the basis of the NCCLS breakpoints
for the FLC resistance of C. albicans, involving multiefflux
mechanisms, the MICs of SS750, FLC, and ITC were 16,
64, and8 g/ml, respectively, for two resistant strains (data
not shown). SS750 showed cross-resistance and might be a
substrate for an efflux pump for these two strains. The MIC50
and MIC90 of SS750 for FLC-resistant C. albicans including
resistant and dose-dependent susceptible strains were 1 and
16 g/ml, respectively. In a comparison of the MIC50s, SS750
was 32 times more potent than FLC and 2 times less potent
than ITC and AMB. The MIC90s of SS750 for Candida parap-
silosis, C. krusei, and C. glabrata, i.e., Candida species less
susceptible to FLC, were 0.25, 1, and 2 g/ml, respectively.
SS750 was 32 to 64 times more potent than FLC and had
potency comparable to or slightly less than that of ITC; the
performance of SS750 was comparable to that of AMB. SS750
showed better activities against Candida tropicalis, Candida
guilliermondii, Candida kefyr, and C. neoformans, with an
MIC90 range of 0.063 to 2 g/ml. SS750 was four to eight times
more active than FLC and was slightly less active than ITC.
The performance of SS750 was comparable to that of AMB.
Moreover, the MIC50s of SS750 for Candida species and C.
neoformans ranged from 0.031 to 1 g/ml. In a comparison of
the MIC50s, SS750 was four or more times more potent than
FLC and had potency comparable to those of ITC and AMB.
Therapeutic effects against systemic and pulmonary candi-
diasis in immunosuppressed mice. The therapeutic effects of
SS750, FLC, and ITC against systemic and pulmonary candi-
diasis caused by C. albicans IFM 40009 in immunosuppressed
mice after oral administration for 4 consecutive days are shown
in Fig. 2. SS750, FLC, and ITC prolonged the number of days
of survival in animals with systemic and pulmonary candidiasis
in a dose-dependent manner. SS750 at doses of 0.25 and 1
mg/kg of body weight per day in animals with systemic and
pulmonary candidiasis, respectively, significantly prolonged the
number of days of survival compared with those for the ani-
mals in the untreated control group (P  0.01). When the
substances were compared according to the minimum dose
necessary to yield significantly prolonged survival, SS750 was 4
and 64 times more potent against systemic candidiasis than
FLC and ITC, respectively, and was also 4 and64 times more
potent against pulmonary candidiasis than FLC and ITC, re-
spectively.

synthesis in cell extracts and their activities on the inhibition of
growth of C. albicans ATCC 90028 and C. krusei ATCC 6258
are listed in Table 2. SS750, FLC, and ITC inhibited the in-
corporation of [14C]mevalonate into the ergosterols of C. al-
bicans and C. krusei at concentrations less than their MICs.
The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of SS750 for ergos-
terol biosynthesis in cell extracts and the MIC of SS750 for C.
albicans were 0.019 and 0.17 M, respectively. For C. albicans,
the inhibitory effect of SS750 on ergosterol biosynthesis in cell
extracts was 1.5 times stronger than that observed with FLC,
and it was identical to that observed with ITC; the antifungal
activity of SS750 was 4.8 times stronger than that observed for
FLC but was 4.3 times less than that observed for ITC. SS750
also inhibited ergosterol synthesis in cell extracts, with an IC50
of 0.21 M, and at 1.36 M it inhibited the growth of C. krusei.
For C. krusei, the inhibitory effect of SS750 on ergosterol
biosynthesis in cell extracts was 3.7 times stronger than that
observed for FLC, and it was identical to that observed for
ITC; the SS750 MIC was 76.8 times lower than that of FLC but
was 3.9 times higher than that of ITC.
Affinity of binding to microsomal cytochrome P450. The
affinities of binding of SS750 and reference drugs, shown by
CO displacement rates, to fungal and mammalian microsomal
cytochrome P450s are presented in Fig. 3. SS750, FLC, and
ITC inhibited CO and cytochrome P450 (CO-P450) complex
formation in samples from C. albicans and C. krusei cultures in
a dose-dependent manner. The CO displacement rates of
SS750 at 0.1 and 0.3 M for C. albicans cytochrome P450 were
47.8 and 6.7%, respectively. The binding affinities of SS750
were similar to those of FLC at 0.1 and 0.3 M, but they were
weaker than that of ITC at 0.1 M (P  0.01) and similar to
that of ITC at 0.3 M. Moreover, the CO displacement rates of
SS750 at 0.1 and 0.3 M for C. krusei cytochrome P450 were
52.4 and 22.2%, respectively. The binding affinity of SS750 was
similar to that of FLC, weaker than that of ITC at 0.1 M (P
0.05), stronger than that of FLC (P  0.01), and similar to that
of ITC at 0.3 M. In contrast, the CO displacement rates of
SS750 at 30 and 300 M for rat liver and human liver cyto-
chrome P450s were 96.1 and 83.9% and 95.5 and 90.2%, re-
spectively. The binding affinities of SS750 were similar to those

DISCUSSION
Numerous attempts have been made to develop novel anti-
fungal agents because of the recent increases in the rates of
fungal infections in immunocompromised hosts. However,
only a few agents are clinically available, despite the increased
need for drugs with more effective and safer profiles than those
currently available. In the present study, SS750 was evaluated
for its potential as an antifungal agent.
The in vitro antifungal activities of SS750 against the Can-
dida species and C. neoformans strains tested were stronger
than those of FLC. Although FLC-resistant C. albicans strains
resistant on the basis of NCCLS breakpoints may show cross-
resistance to SS750, the most important advantage of SS750 is
its increased activity against strains that are intrinsically resis-
tant to FLC, such as C. krusei and C. glabrata. Furthermore, in
the survival study, oral SS750 proved to be the most effective
drug treatment for systemic and pulmonary candidiasis caused
by C. albicans in immunosuppressed mice. The pharmacoki-
netic study of SS750 was reported by Kogure et al. (T. Kogure,
K. Yoshimura, R. Ikeda, I. Kawase, K. Kuramoto, H. Oka, and
K. Tachibana, Abstr. 40th Intersci. Conf. Antimicrob. Agents
Chemother., abstr. 1082, p. 198, 2000). Although SS750 is
eliminated quickly (elimination half-life, 1.4 h) after adminis-
tration of a single oral dose of SS750 (4 mg/kg of body weight)
to male rats, it has a maximum concentration in serum of 1.89
g/ml, and the area under the plasma concentration-time
curve from time zero to infinity is 7.07 g  h/ml. Moreover,
SS750 is highly bioavailable (75.8%). Radiolabeled SS750 has
been demonstrated to have a high absorption ratio (93.7%),
to be widely distributed throughout the body, and to have a
relatively low plasma protein-binding rate (52.9 to 63.3%) in
rats. The pharmacokinetic properties of SS750 participate in its
high degree of efficacy in animal models; however, further
examination will be necessary in order to interpret the in vivo
results.
In order to elucidate the mechanism for the observed in
vitro increase in the antifungal activity of SS750 against C.
krusei, we focused on the inhibitory effects on cell-free ergos-
terol biosynthesis, as catalyzed by cytochrome P450 sterol 14-
demethylase (P45014dm), the target enzyme; we also observed
the affinity of binding of SS750 to microsomal cytochrome
P450 by CO-P450 complex formation in C. krusei. Moreover, as

of 100 M because of its insolubility. The differences in absorbance between 448 nm (C. albicans and C. krusei) or 450 nm (rat liver and human
liver) and 490 nm are shown as a percentage of that observed in controls. Results are the means 	 standard errors of three experiments. Symbols:

C. krusei is inherently resistant to FLC. Orzco et al. (16)
reported that this resistance is due to the decreased suscepti-
bility of P45014dm to the inhibitory effect of FLC. The results of
our studies with FLC and C. albicans and C. krusei resembled
those reported by Orzco et al. (16), although the strains used
in that study were different from those used in the present
study. Briefly, the inhibitory effect of SS750 on P45014dm in the
cell extract of C. krusei was greater than that of FLC (i.e., by
3.7 times), whereas SS750 inhibited the P45014dm of C. albicans
a little more effectively than FLC did (i.e., by 1.5 times). Fur-
thermore, it is well known that the intracellular accumulation
of antifungal agents is important for their antifungal activities.
Marichal et al. (11) reported that the low level of intracellular
accumulation of FLC due to its highly hydrophilic property
perhaps contributes much more to the primary resistance of C.
krusei to FLC. From our results, ITC, the most hydrophobic
triazole in the present study, showed the strongest antifungal
activity among the triazole derivatives tested against C. krusei,
whereas the inhibitory activity of P45014dm against C. krusei
was identical to that of SS750. The Prolog P values, which
estimate hydrophobic properties, were 1.114 for SS750,0.016
for FLC, and 6.074 for ITC. SS750, which possesses the ethyl-
sulfonyl gem-difluoromethylene moiety, is more hydrophobic
than FLC, and it might accumulate in C. krusei and the other
Candida species and C. neoformans strains tested to a greater
extent than FLC did, resulting in the increased growth-inhib-
itory activity of SS750 (11). A comparative study of the intra-
cellular accumulations of radiolabeled SS750 and the reference
drugs will be necessary to elucidate further the mechanisms of
the activity of SS750 against C. krusei.
SS750 and FLC showed similar strong binding affinities to
microsomal cytochrome P450 in C. albicans. This result reflects
the considerable differences in the inhibitory effects of
P45014dm in the cell extract, as reported previously for FLC
(23). Although SS750 showed a relatively strong affinity of
binding to microsomal cytochrome P450 in C. krusei, FLC did
not. These results appear to correlate with the inhibitory ac-
tivities of SS750 and FLC for the C. albicans and C. krusei
P45014dms. ITC showed a strong affinity of binding to micro-
somal cytochrome P450, suggesting that in C. albicans and C.
krusei, ITC is a more potent inhibitor of CO-P450 complex
formation than either SS750 or FLC.
Cytochrome P450s are a superfamily of heme-containing
mixed-function oxygenases that are expressed in many mam-
malian tissues and that are found in the highest levels in liver
tissue. Therefore, safe azole antifungal drugs must be highly
selective for fungal cytochrome P450 as opposed to mamma-
lian cytochrome P450. The binding affinity of SS750 for mam-
malian cytochrome P450 was weak even at a concentration of
300 M, a finding similar to that observed in the case of FLC.
In contrast, the affinity of binding of KTC to mammalian cy-
tochrome P450, even at a concentration of 10 M, was stron-
ger than that of SS750. KTC is known to negatively affect
steroid synthesis in adrenal and other tissues in humans by
inhibiting human cytochrome P450 (4, 18). In contrast, FLC is
a well-known antifungal agent with fewer adverse effects than
those observed with KTC treatments. The affinity of binding of
SS750 to mammalian cytochrome P450 was comparable to that
of FLC. Accordingly, as for FLC treatment, treatment with
SS750 is expected to result in adverse effects that are fewer in
number and less severe than those produced by treatment with
KTC. However, further evaluation of the effects of SS750 on
cytochrome P450 in humans will be necessary to ensure the
safety of treatment with this drug, i.e., with regard to its po-
tential for drug-drug interactions and genetic polymorphisms.
In conclusion, the in vitro activity of SS750 against Candida
species and C. neoformans is stronger than that of FLC. In
particular, the most important advantage of SS750 is its in-
creased activity against C. parapsilosis, C. krusei, and C. gla-
brata. Furthermore, SS750 shows a higher degree of efficacy
against candidiasis caused by C. albicans in mice. SS750
strongly inhibits P45014dm and binds to the cytochrome P450 of
C. krusei, indicating that SS750 acts by inhibiting fungal cell
P45014dm. Moreover, SS750 appears to have less of an affinity
to mammalian cytochrome P450. These data suggest that
SS750 might have potential for clinical efficacy in the treatment
of deep mycoses caused by Candida species
