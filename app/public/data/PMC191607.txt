Nonoxynol 9 (non-9) is the active ingredient in a wide variety of vaginal contraceptive preparations. The
manufacturer recommendation for optimal contraceptive practice is repeated application every 6 h. We studied
the in vitro activity of non-9 against Chlamydia trachomatis (E/UW-5/Cx) and its toxicity against HeLa 229 cells
and monkey cervical epithelial cells. With a contact time of 6 h, non-9 was toxic to HeLa cells at concentrations
of 50 ,ug/ml or greater and to monkey cervical cells at 100 ,ug/ml or greater. Inhibitory effects of non-9 on
extracellular chiamydiae were observed at concentrations of 50 ,ug/ml or greater. Inhibition of intracellular
growth of chlamydiae in monkey cervical cells was observed at a nontoxic concentration of 50 ,ug/ml. Our
studies show that non-9 has antichlamydial activity. However, owing to its toxicity to cervical cells in vitro, the
effects of prolonged use of non-9 in vivo should be further studied.
Chlamydia trachomatis is one of the most common sexu-
ally transmitted pathogens. A contraceptive that is effective
against chlamydiae would provide a means of birth control
as well as prophylaxis against sexually transmitted diseases.
Many in vitro studies on the antimicrobial activity of the
active spermicide ingredient nonoxynol 9 (non-9) against C.
trachomatis have been done in continuous cell lines. The
results have been controversial. Non-9 is the active ingredi-
ent in a wide variety of vaginal contraceptive foams, creams,
jellies, and suppositories. Earlier in vitro studies using non-9
have demonstrated antimicrobial activity against Neisseria
gonorrhea (4, 12), Trichomonas vaginalis (4, 12), Trepo-
nema pallidum (12), Candida albicans (13), Herpes simplex
virus (2, 14), and Ureaplasma urealyticum (1). Many at-
tempts have been made to assess such activity against C.
trachomatis infection in vitro. Benes and McCormack (3)
and Kelly et al. (8) have demonstrated inhibition of C.
trachomatis growth in McCoy cell cultures. Cytopathologic
effects on McCoy cells, a mouse line, have also been
described (8). In contrast, data from Kappus and Quinn (7)
and Knight et al. (9) have not demonstrated inhibition of C.
trachomatis growth in cultures of the same cells. To under-
stand the effects of non-9 on C. trachomatis infection
further, we examined this active spermicide ingredient under
more physiological conditions by using a continuous human
cell line, HeLa 229, and primary monkey cervical epithelial
cells to assess the toxicity of the drug and its bactericidal
activity against C. trachomatis under conditions nontoxic to
host cells.

229 cell cultures (10). An inoculum was partially purified by
one cycle of differential centrifugation, which yielded 108 to
109 inclusion-forming units of C. trachomatis organisms
from a 32-oz (947-ml) culture bottle. A control inoculum was
prepared from uninfected cultures processed as infected
cultures. Serovar E was selected because it is the most
common serovar of genital isolates (11).
Monkey cervical epithelial cell culture. Monkey (Macaca
nemestrina) cervix tissue was obtained from the Tissue
Program at the Regional Primate Research Center at the
University of Washington. The tissue was cut into small
pieces and rinsed in warm Hanks balanced salt solution
(GIBCO Life Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif.) con-
taining 100 ,g of streptomycin, 100 U of penicillin, and 0.25
,ug of amphotericin B per ml. After rinsing, the tissues were
digested with 0.25% pronase at 37°C for 40 min. Subse-
quently, thin layers of the cervical epithelium were peeled
off of the underlying stroma by using fine forceps under a
dissecting microscope. The epithelial layers were rinsed in
serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DS me-
dium; GIBCO, Santa Clara, Calif.) and treated with 0.1%
trypsin for 5 min at 37°C. The epithelium was then dissoci-
ated into a single-cell suspension by repeated pipetting
through a 25-gauge hypodermic needle. The cells were
washed with culture medium that consisted of modified
Eagle's medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% new
horse serum and contained 200 U of penicillin and 2.0 mg of
neomycin per ml (NHS). The cells were collected by cen-
trifugation at 800 x g for 8 min. The cells suspended in NHS
were counted with a hemacytometer and plated in a Rose
chamber (6) at 1.5 x 106 per chamber or a four-well multidish
(Nunclon, Roskilde, Denmark) at 106 per well. The cells in
the Rose chamber were incubated at 37°C, and those in the
four-well multidish were incubated at 37°C in a 2% CO2
atmosphere saturated with moisture. The cell culture me-
dium was replaced with penicillin-free NHS on day 2 or 3
after culture and regularly three times per week thereafter.
Cells reached a state of confluence by 5 to 7 days in culture
and remained as such for 18 days without treatment or
infection (see Fig. 1A).

TOXICITY OF NONOXYNOL 9 FOR C. TRACHOMATIS 1479
Toxicity assay. (i) HeLa 229 cells (continuous cell line).
HeLa 229 cells grown on a 12-mm-diameter coverslip in a
1-dram (4-ml) vial shell were treated with 0 to 150 p,g of
non-9 per ml in chlamydial transport medium, sucrose-
phosphate-glutamic acid medium, for 1 h at room tempera-
ture to simulate the adsorption of C. trachomatis to HeLa
cells during inoculation. The medium was then removed.
The cell monolayers were either washed twice with Hanks
balanced salt solution or not washed and cultured with
Eagle's minimum essential medium (GIBCO) containing
10% fetal bovine serum and 100 ,g each of streptomycin and
vancomycin per ml (MEM) for 72 h at 37°C.
HeLa 229 cell monolayers were also incubated with 0.1 to
150 ,ug of non-9 per ml or the base (inactive ingredient) at 2
and 5% in MEM for 6, 24, or 72 h at 37°C to simulate the
culture of infected cells as in the assay of non-9 for antichla-
mydial activity described below.
(ii) Monkey cervical epithelial cells. Monolayers of monkey
cervical epithelial cells were incubated with 0 to 1,000 ,ug of
non-9 per ml in penicillin-free NHS for 1 or 6 h at 37°C. After
1 or 6 h of contact with non-9, the cell monolayers were
washed twice, overlaid with penicillin-free NHS, and incu-
bated for 48 h at 37°C.
(iii) Evaluation of cellular integrity. Assessments of cell
death were based on morphological criteria (5). The epithe-
lial cells were in a subconfluent state for the first 4 days. By
days 5 to 7, the cultures had become a confluent monolayer
of epithelial cells and they remained confluent for 18 days.
Multilayering and cell differentiation followed the confluence
period for about 7 days. Toxicity was assessed by calculating
the percentage of cell death under x400 magnification after
the cells were fixed with absolute methanol and stained with
Giemsa stain (Fig. 1B).
Assay of antichlamydial activity. The antichlamydial activ-
ity of non-9 was evaluated in two systems: inhibition of
organism growth in cell culture and toxicity to extracellular
organisms.
For inhibition of cell culture growth of chlamydiae, 5- to
7-day-old monkey cervical cell monolayers were inoculated
with 105 infection-forming units of C trachomatis. The
inoculated cells were overlaid with penicillin-free NHS
containing 50 ,ug of non-9 per ml and incubated for 6 h at
37°C. The culture medium was removed. The cell monolay-
ers were washed with Hanks balanced salt solution and
overlaid with penicillin-free NHS containing no non-9 and
further incubated for 48 h at 37°C. Half of each culture was
stained for inclusion counts, and the other half was har-
vested and the yield of infectious organisms was assayed by
titration in HeLa cell cultures without non-9. For passages,
the culture medium was removed and the cells were har-
vested in 0.3 ml of sucrose-phosphate-glutamic acid medium
by scraping with a Pasteur pipette. New HeLa cell mono-
layers were inoculated with the harvested cells. After the
infected cells were fixed with absolute methanol and stained
by Giemsa, the antichlamydial activity of non-9 was deter-
mined by counting (under x400 magnification) the cytoplas-
mic inclusions in 10 randomly chosen fields per well among
eight wells per experiment. Each field contained 100 cells.
For the toxicity assay, chlamydial organisms were treated
with 50 p,g of non-9 per ml for 6 h at 37°C prior to inoculation
of HeLa cells. Control organisms treated with buffer con-
tained no non-9. The viability of non-9-treated or control
organisms was tested by the cell culture infectivity assay as
described above.
TEM. The condition of primary cultures of monkey cer-
vical cells was also assessed by transmission electron mi-

croscopy (TEM). For TEM, the cells were fixed with Kar-
novsky's fixative and then osmium tetroxide. The cells were
then stained with uranyl acetate, dehydrated through a
graded series of alcohol washes, and embedded in Epon
(Ernest F. Fullam, Schenectady, N.Y.) en bloc. Thin sec-
tions were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and
viewed in a CM 10 TEM (Philips Electronic Instruments,
Mahwah, N.J.).
Statistics. Data were evaluated by using a chi-square test
for a two-by-two contingency table.
RESULTS
Toxicity of non-9 for cultured cells. For 1 h of contact time
without washing followed by incubation for 72 h without
non-9, non-9 was toxic to HeLa 229 cells at concentrations
of 30 to 50 jig/ml. A toxicity of 50 to 99% was observed.
Concentrations of non-9 of less than 12.5 p,g/ml were non-
toxic. HeLa cells remained normal. Residual drug caused
toxicity in the unwashed cultures. At concentrations of less
than 50 pg/ml for 1 h of incubation and two washes, no cell
death was observed. In comparison, 30 to 80% cell death
was observed at 100 to 150 ,g non-9 per ml for 1 h of contact
time followed by removal of the residual non-9 by two
washes (Fig. 1 and Table 1).
The toxicity of non-9 increased with increasing concentra-
tions and/or increasing contact times (Table 1). Concentra-
tions of non-9 of c25 ,g/ml for 6 h of contact time did not

result in cell death. However, 20, 75, and 90% cell death
appeared when the concentrations of non-9 were increased
to 50, 75, and 100 ,ug/ml, respectively. When the contact
time was prolonged to 24 h, the concentration that was
nontoxic at 6 h of exposure (25 ,ug/ml) became toxic and
caused 99% cell death. After reduction of the concentration
to .1.25 jig/ml, HeLa cells showed normal morphology after
72 h of incubation in the presence of non-9.
No toxicity was observed when HeLa cells were treated
with the inactive ingredient base at 2 and 5% for 72 h at 37°C.
Primary cultures of monkey cervical epithelial cells were
more tolerant to non-9 (Table 2). After 1 h of contact time,
no cell death was observed at concentrations of up to 150 ,ug
of non-9 per ml. However, 80% cell toxicity was observed
with a concentration of 500 ,ug/ml. Incubation with 100 ,ug/ml
for 6 h caused 10% cell toxicity, while 500 ,ug/ml caused 80%
cell death. Concentrations that were nontoxic for 6 h of
contact were less than 50 p,g/ml. With prolonged contact
time, the concentration of non-9 must be reduced to avoid
toxicity. For 48 h of contact, concentrations of 50 to 100 ,ug
of non-9 per ml caused 20 to 100% cell death. Concentrations
of 10 ,ug/ml were nontoxic.
Toxicity to extracellular organisms. Significant inhibition of
C trachomatis infectivity by non-9 was also apparent after
C trachomatis organisms were treated with 50 p,g of non-9
per ml for 6 h at 37°C. The non-9 treated organisms were less
infectious than untreated organisms in four of five experi-
ments. The mean percentage of HeLa cells with inclusions(± the standard deviations) were 14.7 ± 7.1 and 27.2 ± 13.5
among those infected with non-9-treated and untreated C
trachomatis, respectively (n = 5; P < 0.001). This condition
simulates the recommended use of the spermicide every 6 h.

nificant inhibition of C. trachomatis infection by non-9 was
found after infected monkey cervical cells were incubated
with MEM containing non-9 at the nontoxic concentration of
50 ,ug/ml for 6 h at 37°C. The mean percentage of monkey
cervical epithelial cells with inclusions (+ the standard
deviations) were 24 + 4.0 and 31 ± 4.3 among those infected
with first-passage non-9-treated and untreated C. trachoma-
tis organisms, respectively (n = 6; P < 0.001), and they were
13 ± 5.4 and 22 ± 4.6, respectively (n = 6; P < 0.001),
among those infected with second-passage organisms.
Ultrastructural findings. Ultrastructural findings showed
effects of non-9 on chlamydiae as well as host cells. Infected
cells treated with 100 p,g of non-9 per ml for 1 h showed
well-formed inclusions. However, the inclusions contained
reduced numbers of elementary bodies (EBs). When the
concentration of non-9 was increased to 150 ,ug/ml, inclu-
sions contained only a few mature EBs and most of the
particles were reticulate bodies, with an occasional interme-
diate form within the inclusions (Fig. 2C and D). Cytotoxic-
ity for infected cells compared with infected control cells not
treated with non-9 was not observed at either concentration
of non-9 tested (Fig. 2B). The epithelial cells remained intact
and were characterized by homogeneous cytoplasm that
contained numerous mitochondria and ribosomes (Fig. 2A).
DISCUSSION
We assessed the antimicrobial properties and toxicity of
non-9 and the base components against C. trachomatis in
cervical epithelial cells in vitro. The cytotoxicity of non-9 did
not allow evaluation beyond 25 ,ug/ml for 6 h of contact in
HeLa 229 cells. The concentration could be increased to 100
,ug/ml with minimal cellular toxicity for monkey cervical
cells. With regular use of non-9 over-the-counter contracep-
tives, much higher concentrations of the spermicide than
those used in this study are achieved in the vagina and
cervix.
Studies done by Kappus and Quinn (7) did not demon-
strate any effect of non-9 or the base components on EBs of
C. trachomatis at non-9 concentrations of 20 to 500,000
gg/ml for up to 3 h of contact. In addition, they found no
inhibition of growth when infected McCoy cells were ex-
posed to non-9 for 2 or 72 h. Cytotoxicity to McCoy cells
was observed at concentrations of 14 to 31 ,ug/ml (0.0014 to
0.0031%). In our study, cytotoxicity was also demonstrated
in HeLa cells at concentrations of >25 p,g/ml (0.0025%).
Monkey epithelial cells were more tolerant and sustained no
toxicity at concentratio
