Abstract
Introduction: Primary sternal osteomyelitis is extremely rare in children and only very few cases
have been reported in the international literature.
Case presentation: A 40 days old Caucasian infant was referred to our clinic with a 4 days history
of fever and malaise, accompanying a painful swelling of four days duration involving the lower end of
the sternum. Examination revealed a 2 cm swelling which was fixed to the underlying bone. A full
blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein were measured and x-rays
(Anterior and Lateral views) and Ultrasound was performed. Blood cultures were also taken. The
patient was commenced empirically to Vancomycin and Cefotaxime intravenously.
The values of White Blood Cell (16,720), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (132 mm) and C-reactive
protein (108 mg/dl) were elevated, the X-rays showed bone destruction and dislocation of the 3rd
sternal nuclei and in the U/S performed appeared a soft tissue mass measuring 2,37/1,02 cm related
to the periosteum. Surgical debridement was then performed and swab cultures were taken
intraoperatively. The infant grew Streptococcus Pneumoniae and Enterococcus Species. The infant was
discharged after 25 days from the hospital. He gradually improved over a period of 2 months, became
pain free and repeated x-rays showed significant bone resolution.
Conclusion: Primary osteomyelitis in infants is a very rare condition that usually resolves with
antibiotic therapy and surgical debridement.
Introduction
Primary sternal osteomyelitis in infants is extremely rare.
Very few cases have been reported in the International
literature. In adults it usually occurs secondary to an
underlying predisposition, such as immunodeficiency, IV
drug abuse, Acne Fulminans, planoplantar pustulosis,

cardiothoracic surgery or sternotomy [1-4]. In this review a
case report of a 40 days old female infant is reported and
its diagnosis and management are discussed.
Case presentation
A 40 days old Caucasian infant was referred to our clinic
with a four-day history of fever and malaise, accompany-
ing a painful swelling of four days duration involving the
lower end of the sternum. The infant was delivered with a
normal labour and no incubator was required. The infant
was initially admitted to the hospital in the pediatrics
department due to fever (maximum temperature 39.8°C),
and rhinitis was initially diagnosed. Nine hours after her
admittance she was referred to our clinic and the clinical
examination revealed a 2 cm swelling which was fixed to
the underlying bone. A full blood count, ESR, CRP were
measured and x-rays (Anterior and Lateral views) and
Ultrasound was performed. Blood cultures were also
taken. It is well proved that empiric antimicrobial therapy
should cover Gram positive organisms and should be
commenced once aspirate for cultures have been obtained.
The patient was commenced to Vancomycin and Cefotax-
ime i.v. and was commenced after swab cultures were
obtained.
The values of WBC (17,620), ESR (132 mm) and CRP
(108 mg/dl) were elevated, the X-rays showed bone
destruction and dislocation of the 3rd sternal nuclei
(Figure 1) and in the US performed appeared a soft tissue
mass measuring 2.37 x 1.02 cm related to the periosteum
(Figure 2). A diagnosis of osteomyelitis was made. The
child was prepared for elective exploration and drainage.
At operation, the mass was approached through a long-
itudinal midline incision. A tense collection of pus was
found surrounded by a thin membrane. The membrane
was excised in its entirety and a small amount of the
underlying bone, which appeared abnormal to the naked
eye was removed with a curette. Surgical debridement was
then performed and swab cultures were taken intraopera-
tively. The infant grew Streptococcus pneumoniae and
Enterococcus Species.
The infant was discharged after 25 days from the hospital.
She gradually improved over a period of 2 months and
became pain free. The infant was reexamined 2 months,
1 year and 2 years after her hospitalization in the
outpatients department and repeated X-Rays showed
complete bone resolution (Figures 3 & 4).
Discussion
Sternal osteomyelitis is classified as primary when there is
no other focus of infection and secondary when it occurs
as a complication of median sternotomy, chest trauma,
mediastinitis or subclavian intravenous line insertion.

Primary sternal osteomyelitis in infants is extremely rare.
Only very few cases of primary sternal osteomyelitis in
infants have been reported in the international literature.
Of these, 5 children had sickle cell disease and the
causative organism was Salmonella typhi [5].
Although sternal swelling is uncommon in children
primary sternal osteomyelitis should be considered in
the differential diagnosis.
As with osteomyelitis at other sites, plain radiographs are
often normal initially becoming abnormal after 2 weeks
[6]. However, our patient had significant radiological
findings soon after the onset of symptoms, suggesting that
the disease process may have commenced without
obvious clinical signs. Ultrasound is helpful in defining
soft tissue collections and periosteal involvement, and
technetium bone scan may localize the disease and
exclude other foci of infection. CT scan and MRI are
both useful in delineating the extent of the bony
destruction and retrosternal or mediastinal collections.
MRI is considered to be superior to CT scan [7]. Computed
tomography is also helpful to guide accurate biopsy for
microbiological and histopathologic diagnosis. Bone
scanning can also aid in the diagnosis of osteomyelitis
and in some cases it may show changes earlier than
X-rays [4].
Tissue biopsy is essential in order to exclude primary bone
pathology and to obtain a microbiological isolate that will
direct appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Indirect mea-
sures such as CRP, WBC, and antistaphylosin titers may
assist the diagnosis [8]. Empiric antimicrobial therapy
should cover Gram positive organisms and should be
commenced once aspirate for cultures have been obtained.
Antimicrobials may be rationalized once identification
and sensitivities are known. In our case the infant was
commenced with Vancomycin and Cefotaxime after swab
cultures were obtained for 14 days and continued with
Cefotaxime for 10 more days. After her discharge from the
hospital the i.v. therapy was switched to 14 days of oral
animicrobials (Cefuroxime axetil). The average antibioti
