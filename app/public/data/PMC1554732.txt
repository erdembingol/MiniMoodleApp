SUMMARY
Plasma levels of soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) were measured by immunoassay in 180 individuals,
aged 1-70 years, living in a malaria-endemic community in West Africa. sIL-2R levels were compared
with age, malaria parasitaemia, malaria-associated morbidity and cellular immune responses to
Plasmodiumfalciparum antigens. Plasma levels of sIL-2R were independently associated with both
age and patent malaria parasitaemia. No significant association was observed between IL-2R levels
and concurrent malaria morbidity (i.e. fever associated with malaria), but the number of individuals
with clinical malaria at the time of sampling was small. Although there was no association between
plasma sIL-2R levels and in vitro proliferative responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) to a number of defined malaria antigens, we did find a significant negative association
between sIL-2R and in vitro proliferation of unstimulated PBMC. High levels of sIL-2R (up to 5500
U/ml) were detected in the plasma of malaria-infected individuals; this is indicative of a vigorous
cellular immune response to malaria antigens in vivo and does not support the notion that malaria
infections are generally immunosuppressive. Indeed, we found that, at the low levels of parasitaemia
present in study subjects, there was no significant difference in the mean proliferative response to
malaria antigens in infected subjects when compared with uninfected subjects.

high levels of sIL-2R, cells which have been activated in vivo may
be withdrawn from the peripheral circulation-as has been
shown previously by Hviid et al. [9].
This study also demonstrates that malaria parasitaemia is
not necessarily associated with depressed PBMC responses to
malaria antigens. There was no evidence that lymphoprolifera-
tive responses were inhibited by concurrent parasitaemia. This
may well be a reflection of the rather low parasitaemias found in
the study group, but may also reflect the low frequency of
symptomatic infections. Previously we have observed a marked
decrease in responses to malaria antigens (including F32) in
children with acute symptomatic malaria where mean positive
parasite densities were several fold higher than those observed
here [6]. An association between the degree of suppression of
malaria-specific responses and severity of clinical disease has
been noted in other studies [28], and it seems likely that factors
related to the acute febrile response to malaria parasites may
contribute to the activation and sequestration of malaria-
reactive cells.
